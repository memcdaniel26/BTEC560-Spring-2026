#Author: Mercedes, Date: 02/05/2026, Purpose: Test descriptive measures

#create variable called "variable new" holding 100 variables from 100 to 200
#calculate mean on variablenew for points 150 to 200
#calculate median on variablenew
#calculate mean on variable on variablenew for points 100 to 150

Save the outputs after each function in this value, upload this file in your github repository to get full points.


#variablenew <- 100:200
mean_150_200 <- mean(variablenew[150:200])
median_all<- median(variablenew)
mean_100_150 <- mean(variablenew[100:150])

mean_150_200
median_all
mean_100_150
